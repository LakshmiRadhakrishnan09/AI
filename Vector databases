Using LLM API - May not be relevant
Store the file(related files) at OpenAPI. Use that to give a good response.
How to identify related files?
  use Vector Databases
    - Given an object , find all similar objects
    - If u send a file, process the file, represent that as a point(in n dimension space)
    - Eg: Neon(Postgres with wrapper), PG vector(host in EC2)

When a user ask a query -> send it to vector database -> returns all similar files -> Get the file name -> send this to Model
